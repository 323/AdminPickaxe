AdminPickaxe is a Lua Script to help Administrators do what they do best: Administrate servers.

It has lots of cool features, like viewing a player's current money, being able to see all of the players on the server through the map (chams) and being able to see their distance from you.

It also includes a few misc. commands that are just there for fun, such as flashlight spamming and spazzing out (spinning around while spamming flashlight, etc).

The script will need to be placed in:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua

For it to work correctly. If you're not on a 64-bit operating system, just replace "Program Files (x86)" with "Program Files".

To use the script, simply type:

lua_openscript_cl AdminPickaxe.lua

In console when you're in the game. Then, type:

bind ins "AdminPickaxe_Menu"

But you only have to type that one once. It will bind the "Insert" key on your keyboard to the Admin Pickaxe menu, so that when you press "Insert" the menu will open.

Enjoy!
